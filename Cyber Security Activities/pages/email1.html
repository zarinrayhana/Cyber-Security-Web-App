                            hey I heard that you keep forgeting your password so I have some advice your password needs to be strong but easy to remember so it should follow a pattern that you know for example my password pattern is the name of my pet and the year I was born super easy to remember your password should be something like that

                            Hello all, we have received a lot of users telling us that their password has been stolen, and we take security seriously here and we will look further into improving our security, but in some cases, users have simply been sharing information about their passwords that they shouldnâ€™t have.
                            <br>So please avoid talking about your passwords, or about things that relate to your passwords.
