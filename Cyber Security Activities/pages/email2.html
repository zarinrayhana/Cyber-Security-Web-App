                            It’s not just me, right? People are posting about their passwords a lot lately, is there some sort of game going on? Like a race to have their account hacked the fastest?
                            <br>I hope youre keeping safe during this.

                            <br>Could you help me out? I keep forgetting my password for this site and I need you to help me remember it. I’m not going to tell you what it is, but it’s my hometown, the year I graduated and my sister’s name. In that order. If I every forget my password tell me that.

                            Hey, I just heard that SuperJames32 and CPUBFF went to the same schools in their home town at about the same time but never spoke to each other until joining this site. Weird, right? You’d think they would have known each other after all that time, right?
