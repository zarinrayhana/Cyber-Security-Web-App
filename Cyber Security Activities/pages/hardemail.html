            Due to some major issues with the system, we have disabled many functions of the site until we can fix them. The site is still accessible so that everyone can still access their data. However, there is some issues present even though much of the sites functions disabled, some users have reported receiving posts and viewing posts by people that they shouldn’t.  

We apologise for the inconvenience, we are working on this, and we will have this all fixed as soon as possible.

                            It’s not just me, right? People are posting about their passwords a lot lately, is there some sort of game going on? Like a race to have their account hacked the fastest? 

I hope youre keeping safe during this. </p>

    <p> Hey 
    </p>
    <p>Could you help me out? I keep forgetting my password for this site and I need you to help me remember it. I’m not going to tell you what it is, but it’s my hometown, the year I graduated and my sister’s name. In that order. If I every forget my password tell me that. </p>
    <p>thanks</p>

    <p> Hey,
    </p>
    <p>I just heard that SuperJames32 and CPUBFF went to the same schools in their home town at about the same time but never spoke to each other until joining this site. Weird, right? You’d think they would have known each other after all that time, right? </p>
    <p>thanks</p>
